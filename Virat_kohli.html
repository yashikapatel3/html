      Virat Kohli is more than just a cricketer—he's an icon who redefined
      Indian cricket with his fitness standards, fearless batting, and
      leadership. His journey from a boy in Delhi to becoming one of the world's

    <h2 class="text m-4">ABOUT
      <hr>
    </h2>

    <p>India has given to the world many a great cricketer but none as ambitious as Virat Kohli.
      To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and
      fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world,
      not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time,
      making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer and the former
      captain of the India national team. He is a right-handed batsman and
      is considered one of the best contemporary batsmen in the world. Kohli
      made his debut for India in August 2008 and has since become one of
      the leading figures in international cricket. Kohli has received
      numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including the Sir
      Garfield Sobers Trophy for ICC Cricketer of the Year in 2017 and 2018.
      He has also been named as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential
      people in the world.

      <h2>PLAYER PROFILE
        <hr>
      </h2>
      <h3>Playing style</h3>
      <p>Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.
        His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,
        and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat.<br> He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive
        range of strokes,
        and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.</p>
      <h3>Agression</h3>
      <p>Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He
        is known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce
        competitiveness.[182][183] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the
        team by example.[184] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his
        career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics
        and former cricketers alike.[185][186] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,
        others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control,
        sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.</p>
